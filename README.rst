IntelliJ Modules Setup Script
=============================

.. contents:: :local:

This script generates all the IML files, library descriptors, and the modules.xml file needed to have a complete Liferay project that successfully resolves imports in JSPs and Java files across the 900+ modules in Liferay.

Using the Script
----------------

If you follow the setup instructions, all you have to do is run the following.

.. code-block:: bash

	ij [/path/to/folder1] [/path/to/folder2] [/path/to/folder3]

The alias assumes that the current working folder is the portal source. If that is all you need, you can simply type ``ij`` with no additional parameters.

All folders that you specify as arguments will be assumed either to be an Ant-based Plugins SDK root (designated by the presence of ``build-common-plugins.xml``), a Blade workspace (designated by the presence of a ``gradle.properties``), or a folder used to store subrepositories (such as those generated by forking subrepositories OR the ``modules`` folder of the ``master-private`` branch).

The script generates ``.iml`` files that are slightly different from the ones that have been committed to Liferay's version control, and the alias adds all ``.iml`` files to an ignore list. You can clear your ignore list with the following.

.. code-block:: bash

	git ls-files -v | grep '^h ' | cut -d' ' -f 2 | xargs git update-index --no-assume-unchanged

Setup Instructions
------------------

To setup the script, please use the following steps.

1. Install `NodeJS <https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/>`__ (tested with NodeJS 0.12.x, 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x)

2. Backup the .idea folder in your portal source in case you dislike the result (other than the ``.iml`` files it creates, the scriptÂ writes its files here)

3. Clone this repository.

.. code-block:: bash

	git clone git@github.com:holatuwol/liferay-intellij.git

4. Add a Bash function that makes it easy for you to call it and do any other setup. Replace ``/path/to/clone/location`` with the path to the ``liferay-intellij`` folder that you created by cloning the repository in step 3.

.. code-block:: bash

	IJ_CLONE_PATH=/path/to/clone/location

	ij() {
		${IJ_CLONE_PATH}/intellij $@
	}

5. Navigate to the portal source.

.. code-block:: bash

	cd /path/to/portal/source

6. Run the following command in order to have it generate the IntelliJ project (workspace will be in the portal source)

.. code-block:: bash

	ij

7. Have IntelliJ open the project rooted at the portal source, and it will load your populated project!

Screenshots of End Result
-------------------------

Screenshots can help clarify what the script does.

First, the module dependency structure created by the script. As noted in the NodeJS training that developed this script, libraries are converted into projects whenever possible, and tag libraries and web module dependencies (``frontend-taglib``) are converted into library dependencies to avoid a bug in IntelliJ's JSP handling.

Next, rather than having each module include every transitive dependency explicitly, the script wires the dependencies as Maven libraries, and then it builds out the descriptors for these Maven libraries and includes all of the dependencies explicitly there. This cleans up the dependency listing so that it more closely resembles the build.gradle.

   :width: 480

And of course, the whole point of this is to get Ctrl+Click working and eliminate as much red in the source files as possible. The script automatically converts library style dependencies into project dependencies, allowing for Ctrl+Click navigation to work between modules. This shows a class in blogs-web knowing how to go to portal-configuration-metatype.

.. image:: intellij3.png
   :height: 360
   :width: 480

This is Ctrl+Click navigation working inside of JSPs.

   :width: 480

IntelliJ recognizes tag libraries when we tell it where to find the TLD files, but not the variables that those tags inject. Thus the ``configurationActionURL`` and ``configurationRenderURL`` in this screenshot is in red. If anyone has any ideas on how to get that working (even if it's just the manual steps you perform in IntelliJ), please let me know!

Download Dependency Sources
---------------------------

The zip also contains a ``bin/pom.js`` script generates pom.xml files that list module library dependencies. Having these files allows you to use Maven to download sources for libraries that the modules use. If you'd prefer to have this always run, you can use the following Bash function for ``ij`` instead of the one specified previously.

.. code-block:: bash

	IJ_CLONE_PATH=/path/to/clone/location

	ij() {
		${IJ_CLONE_PATH}/intellij_libsources $@
	}

Additional Notes
----------------

This script comes from a training which taught Java 8 streams concepts using NodeJS. The training materials were originally written for `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`__, so there's also some math expressions that assume MathJax, which isn't available on Github.

Random changes in Liferay's code base layout have broken the training a few times along the way, and so the code is structured to make it easier to maintain for training slides but in a way that may terrify experienced NodeJS developers.
